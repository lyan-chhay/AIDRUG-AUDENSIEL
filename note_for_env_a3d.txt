## The environment a3d is used basically for running A3D for protein, the installation might difer from one platform to another (macos, window, linux).
## In my case , i run on linux, if there is any trouble installing with "environment_a3d.yml" , go  https://bitbucket.org/lcbio/aggrescan3d/src/master/  to see more.



## in case of error with gfortran, find the correct architecture for your machine

# conda install -c anaconda gfortran_osx-64
conda install -c anaconda gfortran_linux-64


## in case of error related to 'Modeller', you might need to add the "key" as follow:
KEY_MODELLER=MODELIRANJE conda install -c salilab modeller


## in case you use 'dynamics ' mode of aggrescan3d, there might be some error, you need to do as follows:
# #go to this
# ~/miniconda3/envs/agg3d/lib/python2.7/site-packages/CABS/pdblib.py
# #change this
# proc = Popen([self.DSSP_COMMAND, '/dev/stdin'], stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)
# #to this
# proc = Popen(['mkdssp', '/dev/stdin'], stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)
