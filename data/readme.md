# Datasets

This project utilizes two primary datasets for predicting aggregation propensity scores for proteins and antibodies in **csv folder**:

1. **data60_fixed_split.csv**  
   - Contains the **aggregation propensity score** for each residue in the **Protein** dataset.

2. **antibody.csv**  
   - Contains the **aggregation propensity score** for each residue in the **Antibody** dataset.


Note: there should also be other folders such pdb, graph , etc, as you processed the graph in preprocessing part. 
Otherwise only the 2 csv files above are necessary for the training.
