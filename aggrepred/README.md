# Model Training

This section covers the training process for the models used in protein and antibody aggregation prediction. It is divided into three main notebooks, each responsible for different model types, as well as a separate notebook for visualizing the results.

## Training Notebooks

1. **Protein Aggregation - Sequence-Based Model**
   - This notebook contains the code for training a sequence-based model on the protein aggregation dataset.

2. **Antibody Aggregation - Sequence-Based Model**
   - This notebook is dedicated to training the sequence-based model for predicting antibody aggregation propensity.

3. **Graph-Based Model Training**
   - This notebook contains the training code for a graph-based model, used as an alternative approach to predict aggregation using graph structures of protein and antibody data.

## Result Notebook

A separate notebook is included for generating plots and visualizing the performance metrics of the trained models.
